# unity-obstacle-course
I created this obstacle course while playing around and learning more about Unity. It consists of 3 main obstacle types: spinning objects, falling objects, and rolling objects (balls that roll down from side ramps). The "game" keeps track of how many objects you've hit, but it's not as much of a game, as it is a program to explore and try different things with some basics I've learned.
